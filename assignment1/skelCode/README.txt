=> almost everything works as intended

=> few issues I'm having SOMETIMES is when the user calls to delete or play from an empty playlist, or add from an empty song library the program crashes. That could be fixed with exception/error handling

=> another issue comes up when the user is supposed to put a number but they put a string character. Again that could be fixed  with exception/error handling 

=> other than that, everything I've tested works fine (assuming the user runs the program as intented) 

=> i haven't tried edge cases
