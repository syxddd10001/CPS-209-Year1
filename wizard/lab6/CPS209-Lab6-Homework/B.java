 *
 * methodX(v + K) for some integer K >= 1
 *
 *      or
 *
 * super.methodX(v + K) for some integer K >= 1
 *
 *      or
 *
 * Some methods may need no additional lines.
 * YOU SHOULD NOT ADD ANY OTHER KINDS OF LINES
 *
 * Ignore the line length hints, as they will not help. Moreover, you should
 * examine InheritanceTester to see what the expected outputs are. That will
 * help you figure out what the different constant K values should be and which
 * methods are called in where.
