/**
 A FillInQuestion is a type of question where the responder has to fill in the
 blanks. You should complete the constructor for this question.

 An object of this class is constructed with
 a string that contains the question and the answer.
 The answer is marked by underscores at the start and end,
 for example:

 "The inventor of Java was _James Gosling_".

 The question should be displayed as

 The inventor of Java was _______________.

 Note the number of underscores in the question is
 2 plus the length of the answer string, in this case,
 2 + 13 = 15.

 You should complete the following tasks:

   - Complete the constructor

     A constructor method to initialize the inherited text and answer variables (of type string)
     For example, if parameter questionText is:
     "The inventor of Java was _James Gosling_".
     then text should be set to
     "The inventor of Java was _______________".

     "James Gosling"
     The answer string may be in the middle, as in questionText:
     "A Canadian, _James Gosling_, invented Java".
     in which case text should be:
     "A Canadian, _______________, invented Java".
