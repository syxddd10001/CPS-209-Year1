/**
   This class represents a province with a name, population, and area. For this
   problem, you should complete the following:

   - Create a constructor that initializes the name, population, and area
     according to given parameter values
   - Complete the "getProvinceStats" method which returns a string with the
     province's stats as specified
   - Complete the "getPopulationDensity" method which returns the population
     density
   - Complete the "compareDensity" method which compares the density of another
     province to this province and returns an integer value as specified

   This class is tested by ProvinceTester.java, which will also help you further
   understand the method definitions.
