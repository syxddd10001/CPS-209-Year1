/**
  This class represents a person and their list of friends (first names only),
  stored as a string with names separated by a space. For this problem, you
  should complete the following:

  - Complete the "befriend" method, which adds the given person to the list of
    friends
  - Complete the "unfriend" method, which removes a given person from the list of
    friends

  This class is tested by PersonTester.java, which will also help you further
  understand the method definitions.
