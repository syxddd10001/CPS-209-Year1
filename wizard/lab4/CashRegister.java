/**
   A cash register totals up sales of several items purchased by a customer, totals up the payment made,
   and computes change due.
   In this class, you should complete the following tasks:

   - Implement "recordPurchase" which adds the given item price to the current total
   - Implement "enterPayment" which takes in a given number of Coin objects, and updates the current
     total paymennt made.
   - Implement "giveChange" which calculates the amount of change to be returned after payment

   This class is uses Coin.java and is tested in CashRegisterTester.java
