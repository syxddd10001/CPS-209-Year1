/**
  This class represents a microwave oven. It stores a timer as an integer and
  a string indicating whether the power is high or low. For this problem, you
  should complete the following:

  - Complete the constructor to initialize the timer to 0 and the power level
    to low
  - Complete the "increaseTime" method to increase the time on the timer by
    30 seconds
  - Complete the "switchPower" method to switch between low and high power, or
    vice versa
  - Complete the "reset" method which resets the timer to 0 and power level to
    low

  This class is tested by MicrowaveTester.java, which will also help you further
  understand the method definitions.
